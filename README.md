# Dog Whisperer for Amazon Alexa
![Dog Whisperer Logo](logo/dog-whisperer.png)

Dog Whisperer leverages the power of the [FitBark](https://www.fitbark.com/) dog activity and sleep monitor to provide real time data about your dog! In order to use this skill you will need a [FitBark](https://www.fitbark.com/) device and account.

Dog Whisperer enables you to receive real-time sleep and activity information about your dog through seamless voice interaction. You can start a conversation with your dog by saying **"Alexa, ask Dog Whisperer to talk to Max for me"**. Then you can interact with the skill by saying things like, **"What did you do today?"**, **"Did you reach your daily goal?"**. Or you can ask full intent questions like **"Alexa, ask Dog Whisperer how much Max slept yesterday"**.

Ask Alexa how active your dog was today, how much they slept, or how long they were playing. Find out if your dog has reached their [FitBark](https://www.fitbark.com/) daily goal, what your dogs breed is, when their birthday is, how old they are, or what their [FitBark](https://www.fitbark.com/) collar battery level is.
